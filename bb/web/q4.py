- A library is a collection of code built to perform common tasks            |  - API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code .
- Library is written in same language which in which it is used              |  - API can be written in any language
- Library code tends to be relatively stable and bug free.                   |  - APIs should be defined before the code implementing them is implemented. 
- Use of appropriate libraries can reduce the amount of code the need to be  |  - APIs should be stable, although portions of the API can be deprecated 
  written. It will tend to reduce line of code counts for an application     |  - The more broadly used the API the more difficult it is to change it.
  will increasing the rate at which functionality is delivered.              |  - e.g. Google Maps API for JavaScript, flickrj is API for Flickr in JAVA
- Usually, it's better to use a library routine than to write own code.      |         tweepy is an API for Twitter, spotipy is an API for Spotify
- e.g. Numpy is a library of Python for matrices & mathematical handling,    |  
       math is a library to handle numberal operations                       |
